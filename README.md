# Java
This repository documents my systematic practice of recursion in Java, starting from fundamentals and gradually moving toward more complex recursive patterns like subsets and string manipulation.

The goal of this repo is not just solving problems, but building a clear mental model of recursion — base cases, recursive calls, stack behavior, and problem decomposition.

📌 What This Repository Covers

The problems are organized by concept to reflect a learning progression, not random practice.

🔹 Level 01 – Recursion Basics

Foundational problems to understand how recursion works internally.

Factorial

Fibonacci

Sum of digits

Count digits

Reverse number

Palindrome (number & string)

Count steps

Focus:
Base case identification, recursive flow, stack unwinding.

🔹 Arrays with Recursion

Applying recursion beyond numbers.

Linear search

Check if array is sorted

Bubble sort (recursive)

Selection sort (recursive)

Focus:
Index-based recursion, shrinking problem size.

🔹 Strings with Recursion

Recursive manipulation of characters and substrings.

Remove characters

Remove words

Reverse string

String palindrome

Focus:
Substring recursion, immutability, character-level thinking.

🔹 Subsets & Subsequences

Introduction to exponential recursion, a key interview topic.

Generate subsequences

Subsequences with ASCII values

Focus:
Decision trees, include/exclude patterns, recursion branching.

🔹 Patterns (Recursion + Visualization)

Understanding recursion through pattern problems.

Star patterns

Sorting patterns

Focus:
Recursive depth control and visual recursion.

🧠 What I’m Practicing Conceptually

Across these problems, I focus on:

Clear base cases

Well-defined recursive transitions

Avoiding unnecessary recursion

Understanding time & space complexity

Thinking in terms of problem reduction

This repository represents deliberate practice, not copied solutions.

🛠️ How to Run the Code

Language: Java

Each .java file is self-contained

Run using:

javac FileName.java
java FileName


(You can also run directly using any Java IDE.)

📈 Current Status & Next Steps

This repo currently covers beginner to early-intermediate recursion.

Planned extensions:

Backtracking problems (maze, permutations, N-Queens)

Tree recursion (DFS, height, traversal)

Recursion + memoization (DP foundation)

Better documentation per problem

🎯 Why This Repository Exists

This repository exists to:

Strengthen my DSA fundamentals

Build interview-ready recursion intuition

Track my learning progress publicly

Create clean, explainable Java solutions

✨ Final Note

Recursion isn’t about memorizing patterns.
It’s about trusting the function to do its job — one level at a time.
