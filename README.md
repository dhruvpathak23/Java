# Java Recursion, Backtracking & Dynamic Programming

This repository contains my structured practice of recursion in Java, progressing from fundamental recursive problems to advanced backtracking and dynamic programming techniques.

The codebase is organized using standard Java package conventions, with clear naming and logical separation of concepts to reflect real-world project structure.

# 📁 Project Structure

The repository follows a clean, scalable layout:

src/
├── recursion/
│   ├── level 01/
│   ├── arrays/
│   ├── strings/
│   ├── patterns/
│   ├── subsets/

Each folder represents a single core concept, and every file contains one public class with descriptive naming.

Stack unwinding

#🔹 Arrays & Strings Using Recursion

Applying recursion to linear data structures.

Arrays

Linear search

Check if array is sorted

Recursive bubble sort

Recursive selection sort

Strings

Character removal

Substring removal

Reverse string

Palindrome validation

Focus:

Index-based recursion

Shrinking problem size

String immutability

#🔹 Patterns with Recursion

Final Note

Recursion teaches structure.
Backtracking teaches discipline.
Dynamic programming teaches optimization.

This repository reflects all three — with intent.
